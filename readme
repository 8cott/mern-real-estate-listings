To refactor your code to use React, you'll need to:

1. Install the necessary dependencies by running the command `npm install react react-dom`.

2. Create a new file `App.js` to hold your main app component.

3. Update your server-side code to serve the `index.html` file that loads the React app.

4. Rewrite your views as React components in `App.js`.

5. Modify your server-side code to render your `App` component using `ReactDOM.render()`.
